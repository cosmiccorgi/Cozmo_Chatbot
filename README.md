Cozmo Chatbot

NOTE: The model for the chatbot uses large_ft.pkl for the data, however the file is massive so it's best to download it straight from Huggingface. There are smaller versions. but the chatbot is much less coherent using those. 

TO USE: Simply run program and talk into laptop microphone. Cozmo may take a minute to respond. This requires the Cozmo SDK to be set up and functional, as well as torch, speech_recognition, cozmo, and transformers libraries.
